## About The Project

[Twilight Imperium](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/twilight-imperium-fourth-edition/) is a board game about galactic conquest for three to six players. It is an epic experience and a lot of fun. But the game is also quite complex and long. Very long. A typical game might take some good 6 hours. While all this is part of the fun, things can get a bit overwhelming to keep track of. Additionally it is nice to look back at a game and see what strategies work well and what didn't worked well, with the goal to get better next time.

And that's where "Twilight Imperium - Game Tracker" comes enters the stage. The goals of this app is:

1. Provide an easy to use way to track progress during a game
1. Make this progress easily accessible to all players during a game
1. Present an overview of the already scored objectives and open objectives
1. Track basic timing information for each game
1. Store and display the map of each game
1. Make all of the above data accessible after a game for further analysis

The concrete features will evolve over time, but those are our guiding lights so far.
